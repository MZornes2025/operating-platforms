# Operating Platforms Project

## Overview  
This repository demonstrates my understanding of operating system concepts and platform-level software.  
Work includes implementing core OS-related features and understanding how processes, memory, and I/O interact in a real or simulated environment.

## Technologies & Tools  
- Programming Language: [e.g. C / C++ / Python]  
- Constructs: processes or threads, interprocess communication (IPC), concurrency control  
- Memory management (if applicable): paging, virtual memory, or some subset thereof  
- Version control: Git  

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Implemented [process management / thread scheduling / context switching / concurrency primitives] to allow multiple tasks or threads to run in a controlled environment.  
- Built mechanisms for synchronization (mutexes, semaphores, or similar) to avoid race conditions and ensure correct shared resource access.  
- Handled memory allocation tasks (e.g. dynamic allocation, possibly simple paging or memory pools) and implemented safety checks.  
- Developed or used interprocess communication (e.g. message passing, pipes, shared memory) for tasks to communicate.  
- Wrote tests or simulations to demonstrate correct behavior under multiple processes and stress/error conditions.

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- Solid grasp of low-level / system-level programming: concurrency, memory, process management.  
- Ability to implement features close to the OS layer, showing you can work outside of just application code.  
- Understanding of synchronization, resource sharing, and avoiding deadlocks or data races.  
- Practical skill in both designing and validating system behaviors (through tests or simulations).

## How to Run / Explore This Repo  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Compile (if using a compiled language) or set up environment as needed.  
3. Run the executable or simulation that demonstrates process/thread/task scheduling.  
4. Try stress testing with multiple concurrent tasks to show synchronization or race-condition behavior.  
5. Review code modules responsible for memory / process / IPC / scheduling to see your design decisions.

## Optional Notes  
- Coursework project, but all system-level logic, scheduling, and concurrency control are my own work.  
- If available, sample execution logs or performance metrics are included to show how it handles concurrency under load.
